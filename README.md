# Redpasswd
​	A directed brute force cracking tool, after collecting information, generates a special dictionary with the characteristic information of the target, so that every piece of data in the dictionary contains the data of the target characteristics.

The use of this tool requires certain information collection capabilities, such as specific date, number, name abbreviation, etc., for an individual, name abbreviation, specific date, slogan, etc., to make this data into a primitive dictionary, and combine it in a specified way with this program to efficiently verify possible data.

"m1" and "m1.txt" are the source signature databases prepared by the author. Please rewrite the source dictionaries as required

Options explained:

1. Basic module: Do not interfere with the generated dictionary, can limit the maximum number of generated

2. Universal module: Completely unlimited, may generate a large amount of data dictionary, non-necessary please give priority to other modules

3. Non-character module: If the first part of the generated data is a symbol, then this data will be cleared

4. Letter module: the first must be a letter, otherwise the data will not be saved to the output dictionary

5. Uppercase module: The first letter must be uppercase, otherwise the data will not be saved to the output dictionary

This program is only for learning, communication, and testing within the legal scope, and shall not be used for illegal purposes, otherwise all responsibilities shall be borne by the user
